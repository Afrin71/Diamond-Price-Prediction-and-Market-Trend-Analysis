# Diamond-Price-Prediction-and-Market-Trend-Analysis

The objective of the project is to understand the factors that determine diamond pricing, focusing on the critical 4Cs (carat, cut, color, and clarity).

Comprehensive Data Cleaning:
Initial data quality checks (e.g., shape, data types).
Identification and removal of duplicate records (e.g., 146 duplicates were dropped).
Outlier analysis and handling using methods like the Interquartile Range (IQR) specifically applied to the price column.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Univariate and Bivariate visualizations (e.g., histograms of price, box plots across categorical features) to understand data distributions.
In-depth analysis of the correlation between the 4Cs and the final diamond price.

Statistical Insights:
Calculation of descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation) across different categorical groups (e.g., mean price by color and cut).
